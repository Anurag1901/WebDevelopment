    <div class="info">
        <p>Harry Potter is a film series based on the novels by author J. K. Rowling. The series is distributed by Warner Bros. 
        and consists of eight fantasy films, beginning with Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001) and culminating with Harry
        Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 (2011).
        </p>

        <p>The series was mainly produced by David Heyman, and stars Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson as the
            three leading characters: Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger. Four directors worked on the series: Chris Columbus,
            Alfonso Cuarón, Mike Newell, and David Yates. Production took place over ten years, with the main story arc following Harry's 
            quest to overcome his arch-enemy Lord Voldemort
        </p>

        <p>The production designer for all eight films is Stuart Craig. Assisted by Stephenie McMillan, Craig has created iconic sets pieces
            including the Ministry of Magic, the Chamber of Secrets, Malfoy Manor, and the layout for the CGI Horcrux Cave. Because the novels
            were being published as the films were being made, Craig was required to rebuild some sets for future films and alter the design of
            Hogwarts.
        </p>

       <p>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the seventh and final novel in the series, was adapted into two feature-length
           parts. Part 1 was released in November 2010, and Part 2 was released in July 2011.
       </p>

       <p>Deathly Hallows – Part 1, Philosopher's Stone, and Deathly Hallows – Part 2 are among the 50 highest-grossing films of all time, and ranking them as the 
       48th-, 47th-, and 13th-highest-grossing films, with Philosopher's Stone and Deathly Hallows – Part 2 grossed over $1 billion. Without inflation adjustment,
       it is the third highest-grossing film series with $7.7 billion in worldwide receipts.
