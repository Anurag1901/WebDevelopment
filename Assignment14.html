    <p class="two">In 1776, a Military Department was created within the government of the East India Company at Kolkata. Its main function was to record orders that 
       were issued to the army by various departments of the East India Company for the territories under its control. With the Charter Act of 1833, the Secretariat of 
       the government of the East India Company was reorganised into four departments, including a Military Department. The army in the presidencies of Bengal, Bombay and
       Madras functioned as respective Presidency Armies until 1 April 1895, when they were unified into a single Indian Army. For administrative convenience, it was divided 
       into four commands, namely Punjab (including the North West Frontier), Bengal, Madras (including Burma), and Bombay (including Sind, Quetta and Aden).</p>
