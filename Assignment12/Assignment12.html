       You might also say that someone has some meat on thier bones.This is a casual way of saying that they are overweight, and it might
       seem rude to some sensitive people. The opposite of overweight can be thin,skinny or slim.
    </p>
    <p class="p3">Light, <span class="three">yellowish hair </span> can be described as blonde.But you can also call a person who as that kind of hair a blonde.(This means that
