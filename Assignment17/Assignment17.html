    <div class="about">
        <p class="heading2"> Some information </p>
        <p class="info2">The Golden Retriever is a medium-large gun dog that was bred to retrieve shot waterfowl, during hunting and shooting parties. The name "retriever" refers to 
        the breed's ability to retrieve shot game undamaged due to their soft mouth. Golden retrievers have an instinctive love of water, and are easy to train to basic
        or advanced obedience standards. They are a long-coated breed, with a dense inner coat that provides them with adequate warmth in the outdoors, and an outer
        coat that lies flat against their bodies and repels water. The Golden Retriever was originally bred in Scotland in the mid-19th century.</p>

        <p class="heading3">Useful Dog</p>
        <p class="info3">The breed is a prominent participant in conformation shows for purebred dogs. The Golden Retriever is popular as a disability assistance dog, such as being 
        a guide dog for the blind and a hearing dog for the deaf. In addition, they are trained to be a hunting dog, a detection dog, and a search and rescue
        participant. The breed's friendly, gentle temperament means it is unsuited to being a professional guard dog, but its temperament has also made it the third-
        most popular family dog breed in the United States, the fifth-most popular in Brazil and Australia, and the eighth-most popular 
        in the United Kingdom. Golden Retrievers are rarely choosy eaters, but require ample (two hours a day) exercise.The breed is fond of play 
        but also highly trainable.</p>

        <p class="heading4">Size and Personality</p>
        <p class="info4">Males are 23 to 24 inches tall and weigh 65 to 75 pounds. Females are generally 21.5 to 22.5 inches tall and 55
            to 65 pounds. Golden Retrievers usually reach their full height by one year of age, and their mature weight by two. A sweet, 
            calm nature is the hallmark of the breed. The Golden was bred to work with people, and is eager to please his owner. Though hard-
            wired with a good disposition, like all dogs the Golden must be well-raised and well-trained to make the most of his heritage.
            Like people, sights, sounds, and experiences â€” when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Golden puppy grows up to be a 
            well-rounded dog.

    <div class="FandD">
        <p class="heading5">Food and Diet </p>
        <p class="info5">Recommended daily amount: 2 to 3 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.
            How much an adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like 
            people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more 
            than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference â€” the better the dog food, the further it will go 
            toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl. Keep your Golden in good shape by 
            measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's 
            overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.
            You'll need to take special care if you're raising a Golden puppy. These dogs grow very rapidly between the age of four and seven
            months. They do well on a high-quality, low-calorie diet that keeps them from growing too fast.

        <p class="heading6"> Care </p>
        <p class="info6">
            Golden Retrievers are built for action and love outdoor romps. If you like to hike or jog, your Golden will be happy to join
            you. And if you feel like tossing a ball in the backyard, they'd be more than happy to join you; true to their name, Goldens 
            love to retrieve. Tiring them out with 20-30 minutes of vigorous exercise twice a day will keep your dog mellow when he's back 
            inside. Slacking on the activity, however, could lead to behavior problems.            
            Like other retriever breeds, Goldens are naturally "mouthy," and they're happiest when they have something to carry in their mouths:
            a ball, soft toy, newspaper, or best of all, a smelly sock. Don't let your Golden puppy run and play on very hard surfaces such as 
            pavement until he's at least two years old and his joints are fully formed. Normal play on grass is fine, and so are puppy agility 
            classes.
